# Hello there, I'm Andreas! 👋

I'm a 20-year-old 2nd year student at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology at the University Politehnica Bucharest, with a growing interest in Software Engineering. Here's a glimpse into what I've been up to:

- 🔭 Currently, I'm involved in the Bosch Future Mobility Competition 2024. My team and I are working on an autonomous RC car (scale 1/10) to navigate real-life traffic conditions, and we've managed to make it to the international finals.

- 🥈 Recently, I participated in the BEST Engineering Marathon Hackathon sponsored by SAP, where my team secured 2nd place. We built a time series forecasting app using Meta's Prophet and integrated basic personalized recommendations using OpenAI's GPT API.

- 🏆 Additionally, I took part in the natural language processing hackathon, NitroNLP, held at the University of Bucharest, where our team developed a BERT-based binary text classification model with 93.5% accuracy in distinguishing satirical from non-satirical news articles.

- 💻 My journey has exposed me to various domains including embedded programming, Internet of Things, and networking. While still on my learning path, I have garnered some skill in languages such as C, C++, Python, and web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. I know my way around with Linux, comfortable bashing and scripting. I'm also familiar with computer vision (OpenCV), 3D modelling using Autodesk Inventor, circuit simulation with tools like TinaTI and PSpice and digital circuit design with VerilogHDL.

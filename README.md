# Hello there, I'm Andreas! 👋

I'm a 21-year-old 3rd year student at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology at the University Politehnica Bucharest, with a growing interest in Software Engineering. Here's a glimpse into what I've been up to:

- 🔭 I was recently involved in the Bosch Future Mobility Competition 2024. My team and I worked on an autonomous RC car (scale 1/10) to navigate real-life traffic conditions, and we've managed to make it to the international semi-finals.

- 🥈 I've participated in several hackathons, having won a 2nd place medal in one (BESTEM - sponsored by SAP), where I got a glimpse of AI and Machine Learning, working with neural networks -- natural language processing -- time series forecasting -- retrieval-augmented generation and so on.

- 💻 My journey has exposed me to various domains including embedded programming, Internet of Things, and networking. While still on my learning path, I have garnered some skill in languages such as C, C++, Python, and web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. I know my way around with Linux. I'm also familiar with computer vision (OpenCV), 3D modelling using Autodesk Inventor, circuit simulation with tools like TinaTI and PSpice and digital circuit design with VerilogHDL.
